<h1>Image Processor</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The design of our Image Processor begins with the model, which starts with the ImageModel
interface, used to represent operations that can be used to monitor the state of an image model,
without the ability to modify the model itself. We decided to remove the ImageModelState interface
and move its methods to the ImageModel interface while removing the ImageModel interface methods
that manipulated the image models themselves so that the transformation logic would be confined to
the command function objects. The ImageModelImpl class is an implementation of the ImageModel
interface, and one object represents one image that can be transformed through different
operations. One instance of an ImageModelImpl contains a private, final 2-D array of Pixels used
to represent each individual pixel in the PPM image. An individual pixel is represented by the
Pixel class, which implements the IPixel interface that allows us to access but not modify the
individual red, green, and blue values of each Pixel. Within the ImageModelImpl class is a method
'getPixelAt(int row, int col)' which returns a direct reference to the specified pixel from our
2-D array representation, but this causes no issue because all field variable in the Pixel class
are final, meaning it is not possible to modify an existing Pixel. We have removed our ImageUtil
class which contained our load method, and transferred that logic over into the load command
function object as we did with the ImageModel interface methods. We have added in an ImageModelMap
interface, which contains methods that utilize and modify a Map<String, ImageModel>, which our
command function objects now use instead of passing in a Map<String, ImageModel> through the
controller. Implementing this interface is the ImageModelMapImpl class, and one object represents
a map of strings to image models. One instance of this class contains a field with a Map<String,
ImageModel> that the methods can both add to and find entries from.

The design of our Image Processor continues with the controller, which begins with the
ImageController interface, used to represent the controller aspect of our image processor. The
ImageControllerImpl is an implementation of ImageController and is designed to run a suitable
controller for our image processor. This class contains as fields an Appendable object to display
feedback and a Map<String, Function<Scanner, ImageCommand>> that stores each command that is
offered under the string to run it. When initialized, a chosen output Appendable to write to and
ImageModelMap for the command function objects to find image models from and add image models to
are inputted as parameters. A lack of a unique output parameter will result in the controller
using "System.out" as the default output. A user is able to input "q" of "Q" to quit the session
at any time or can enter any amount of commands using the appropriate string and surrounding
inputs, and after a command is run, the new image model and its name will be added into the
ImageModelMap which already contains the existing models. In our program, a user is not limited
to only typing commands into the console, but can also provide a text file as a command line
argument with appropriate commands. After the file has been read from, the console will let the
user input additional commands, at which point they may either do so or quit the program.

The design of our Image Processor takes advantage of the command pattern by utilizing an
ImageCommand interface, which represents performing an operation of an image. The
AbstractImageCommand class, which implements ImageCommand, provides a template for numerous
commands that are similar. Extending the AbstractImageCommand class are the
AbstractTransformationCommand, which is extended by function objects that deal with color
transformations, AbstractFlipCommand, which is extended by function objects that deal with
flipping images, and AbstractFilterCommand, which is extended by function objects that deal with
filtering images. An Appendable object, a Scanner object that reads the name of the existing model
and the name that the new model will be saved to, and an ImageModelMap are passed into a chosen
command, at which point the model being modified is located in the map, operated on by the
specific command, and finally the given ImageModelMap that contains existing key value pairs is
added to so that it also contains the new model and its name. An identical process to this is
performed by the function objects. The color transformation function objects, represented by
RedGreyscale, GreenGreyscale, BlueGreyscale, MaxValueGreyscale, LumaGreyscale, IntensityGreyscale,
and SepiaTone, use AbstractTransformationCommand's protected transform method to create the new
images. Similarly, HorizontalFlip and VerticalFlip use AbstractFlipCommand's protected flip
method, while BlurFilter and SharpenFilter use AbstractFilterCommand's protected filter method.
The remaining three commands follow a similar format; however, Brighten takes in an additional
constant from the scanner, SaveImage creates a new PPM file instead of altering an ImageModelMap,
and LoadImage does not take in an existing image model but instead reads from an existing file.
If a command is attempted to run on an image model that has not yet been loaded in, or if any
other erroneous inputs are entered, an output stream message will convey this to the user.

The design of our ImageProcessor is completed by the view, which utilizes Java's Swing toolkit to
generate a GUI for our interpretation of an image processor.

As far as changes we needed to implement in order to add downscaling functionality went, there
were not very many of note. Our controller utilized a command map, meaning all we had to do was
create a downscale function object which produced a new downscaled image model, and add the
function object to our command map accordingly, as well as add a button to trigger the command
in the GUI view. Since the downscaling takes in two constants, we needed to specify when a view
action was performed to execute an operation that two constants should be looked for before the
new image's name.

Masking required changing our program slightly more in order to accommodate it. The first change
was that, when the command is created and the scanner collects user input, it determines if there
is a mask model inputted based on how many command parameters there are. An array of models is
then created, containing one model if there is no mask, and two if there is. Second, our method
that produces a new image model based on a command previously took in one image model, the
original, and operated on it thus. In order to implement masking, we changed this so that the
method took in the array of models created by our first change. If there was one model in the
array, it would behave as usual; however, if there were two models in the array, the new model
would be created using the second model as a mask.

Allowing for the preview option in the GUI only necessitated additions to the extended view
implementation. A preview button was added which would trigger the preview window to display the
designated preview image. The window consisted of an ImagePanel within a ScrollPane. When the
preview action is first triggered, the designated operation for the preview is done using a mask
covering only the top-left 200x200 pixels of the image, which is the section displayed in the
ViewPort of the ScrollPane. Changes to the ViewPort are tracked such that whenever one occurs,
the positions of each ScrollBar are checked, and a new masked image (again using the designated
operation) is created with the mask matching the position of the image within the ViewPort.

When using the JAR, if no command line arguments are entered, the image program GUI will open to
be interacted with. Conversely, if "-text" is entered as a command line argument, the image
program will open in text form in the console. Additionally, you may enter "-file" followed by a
script filename to execute the file in text form in the console. Two provided scripts to run are
"DownscaleCommandScript.txt", which creates two downscaled images of an original image, and
"MaskCommandScript.txt", which creates edited images for every operation usable with a mask, and
their counterparts created with a mask.
